====================================
FeinCMS 1.6 release notes (upcoming)
====================================


* The default value of ``FEINCMS_REVERSE_MONKEY_PATCH`` has been changed to
  ``False``. Support for monkey-patching the ``reverse()`` method to support
  the old ``'urlconf/viewname'`` notation will be removed in the 1.7 release.

* Deprecated page manager methods have been removed. You should use
  ``Page.objects.for_request`` instead of the following manager methods:

    * ``Page.objects.page_for_path_or_404()``
    * ``Page.objects.for_request_or_404()``
    * ``Page.objects.best_match_for_request()``
    * ``Page.objects.from_request()``

* Deprecated page methods have been removed:

    * ``Page.active_children()``: Use ``Page.children.active()`` instead.
    * ``Page.active_children_in_navigation()``: Use
      ``Page.children.in_navigation()`` instead.
    * ``Page.get_siblings_and_self()``: You probably wanted
      ``self.parent.children.active()`` or
      ``self.get_siblings(include_self=True).active()`` anyway.

* The shortcuts ``Page.register_request_processors()`` and
  ``Page.register_response_processors()`` to register several request or response
  processors at once have been removed in favor of their counterparts which
  only allow one processor at a time, but allow for replacing FeinCMS' included
  processors, ``require_path_active_request_processor`` and
  ``redirect_request_processor``.

* It is not possible anymore to access the request and response processors as
  methods of the ``Page`` class. The processors are all in
  ``feincms.module.page.processors`` now.

* The deprecated support for prefilled attributes has been removed. Use
  Django's own ``prefetch_related`` or ``feincms.utils.queryset_transform``
  instead.

* The deprecated ``feincms.views.base`` module has been removed. The code has
  been moved to ``feincms.views.legacy`` during the FeinCMS v1.5 cycle.

* The value of ``FEINCMS_FRONTEND_EDITING`` defaults to ``False`` now.

* ``ImageContent``, ``FileContent`` and ``VideoContent`` now have pretty
  icons out-of-the-box.

* ``ImageContent`` now accepts optional ``FORMAT_CHOICES`` for use with
  FeinCMS' bundled thumbnailers, as well as ``caption`` and ``alt_text`` fields.

.. note::

   If you are upgrading from an earlier version of FeinCMS, you'll have to
   add the new database columns yourself or use a migration tool like South
   to do it for you. Instructions for MySQL and the page module follow::

       ALTER TABLE page_page_imagecontent ADD COLUMN `alt_text` varchar(255) NOT NULL;
       ALTER TABLE page_page_imagecontent ADD COLUMN `caption` varchar(255) NOT NULL;

   If you want to use ``FORMAT_CHOICES``::

       ALTER TABLE page_page_imagecontent ADD COLUMN `format` varchar(64) NOT NULL;

* ``FileContent`` now displays the size of the file in the default template,
  and uses ``span`` elements to allow styling of the title / size.

* ``MediaFile`` does no longer auto-rotate images on upload. It really is not a
  media library's job to magically modify user content; if needed, it should be
  done in an image filter (like sorl). Also, reading through the image data
  seems to have a side effect on some external storage engines which then would
  only save half the image data, see issue #254.
